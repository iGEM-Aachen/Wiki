<h3>Our project</h3>
<p> 	
	We, the iGEM team Aachen 2018, are addressing a medical issue that has gained tremendous importance in past decades: the diagnosis of melatonin under- and overproduction. Melatonin is primarily known as a sleep hormone. However, as the endocrine research reveals, melatonin regulates all aspects of human physiology: day-night cycle, immune function, hormone release, muscle growth, and reproduction are some of the many physiological properties that melatonin regulates. <!-- KOMMENTAR: Sollte Dr. Michael Colgan noch mit meiner korrekten Qulle aus einem scientific paper auf meine Facebook message (Henri) oder mail (iGEM) antworten, können wir folgenden Satz noch mit rein nehmen: "It is estimated, that around 20% of the human genome is regulated by melatonin, making it he largest control system in human physiology." (Orginaltext aus seinem Fabebook-Beitrag: "[...] This activity uses daily expression of over 20% of your total genome, making melatonin the largest control system in human physiology. [...]" - Dr. Michael Colgan) --> Underproduction of melatonin is primarily associated with insomnia. However, melatonin also plays an essential role in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease), psychological disorders (depression and schizophrenia) and fibromyalgia. Melatonin acts antiproliferative on inflammations, reduces reactive oxygen species and has oncostatic properties.<br>
	Our innovative approach solves the problems of the current melatonin measurements. Providing a faster, cheaper and a more versatile method, is our core motivation.

	<h3>Human Practices</h3>
<p>
	Human practices are an essential part of our project. Engaging in dialogues with researchers, medical professionals and people affected by a pathogenic melatonin level, helped us improving our biosensor by understanding the problems of the current melatonin detection methods. We assembled all relevant information to draw a clear picture of the huge topic concerning melatonin dysfunction. To spread our knowledge, we raised awareness of the problem in public. <br>
	<br>
	We took part in the international March for Science demonstration to fight for free accessibility of scientific research,  we met Emmanuelle Charpentier to discuss the importance of in the scientific community and we dedicated a radio post to raise the awareness of the importance of melatonin in the human body. <br>
	<br>
	To dig deeper into the rights of melatonin deficiency treatments, we interviewed the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board. To meet the challenges of the future, biological applications are going to be more and more relevant. Thus, it is essential to make this work field appealing to young people. Therefore we accomplished numerous goals, such as working together with Germany's greatest scientific student competition "Jugend Forscht" and the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) and completed a school project. Through our collaborations and meetups, we gathered with students from all over the world, shared knowledge and thoughts with each other. To bring our project to the next level, professors, research assistants, students, and other enthusiastic people provided us with advice and assistance.

	<p>
	During the last five months, the team experienced a new style of “life”, we updated our biosafety level and got a new first home. 
	In the laboratory, gloves and tips, western blots and electrophoresis gels, were part of our new daily routine. 
	We thought, worked and lived together. Get to know our lab successes and failures in this <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Wetlab/Notebook">

											<p>At first, we reviewed already available spectrometers. We started with looking into publications on cheap spectrometers<sup><a href="#pubspectro">[1]</a></sup>. 
											The biggest problem with these is that they do not give actual construction data and are only result orientated. 
											So we concentrated on open source diy designs. The ramanPi spectrometer caught our eye<sup><a href="#ramanpi">[2]</a></sup> and we based our design on it. 
											The greatest upside is, that it was developed open source with a detailed construction documentation. </p>
