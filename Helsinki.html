	<h4>Using luciferase under the control of the Estrogen Response Element as reporter</h4>
	<p>During our first months of research we noticed a research group in the Aalto University (Helsinki), 
	who developed a yeast-cell based assay for the detection of different analytes, i. e. Estrogen, using different nuclear receptors. 
	We decided, that the system would be suitable for our project, as we also planned to use the specific nuclear receptor RZR 
	(Retinoid-related orphan receptor-beta) for the detection of melatonin. After contacting the research group, they directly send us their modified strain (BMA64-1A), 
	so that we could use the integrated firefly luciferase gene as a reporter under the control of the Estrogen Response Element (ERE).
