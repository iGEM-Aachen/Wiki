<h3>School project</h3>
	
	<h4>Teaching the basics of microbiology</h4>

	<p>To meet the challenges of the future, biologic applications are going to be more and more relevant. Thus, it is essential to make this work field interesting for young people. With a school project, we tried to make the field of synthetic biology more appealing for them. <br>
	Since we were very surprised about the major role of melatonin in the human body and the little familiarity in the public, we took this opportunity to inform our audience. <br>
	At the beginning of September, we went to 10th-grade students at the Herzogenrath Highschool to show them the fundamentals of lab work. We carried out the lessons on three different days.
	</p>

		<h5>First day:</h5> 
		<p>At the beginning of the first day, we presented the schedule for the upcoming one and a half weeks. After a small introduction about us, we talk about safety in a laboratory, working sterile and different media types for the cultivation of microorganisms. We split the class into groups of four students. First, the students weighed out the different components to prepare a YPD medium in Petri dishes. We autoclaved the media and explained the physical principles of autoclavation. In the end, the pupil poured the YPD medium into the Petri dishes.</p>

		<h5>Second day:</h5>

		<p>On the second day, the students inoculated the Petri dishes. Every group had four Petri dishes: one plate which was exposed to the air, another which was used to test the effect of ampicillin on the growth of microorganisms, and another two where they could test the contamination of different surfaces. Furthermore, we explained the functionality of antibiotics. The plates were incubated at 30Â°C.</p>

		<h5>Third day:<h5>

		<p>Seven days later we evaluated the plates and talked about the different organisms that grew on the Petri dishes. To get a closer look, we used a light microscope to analyze how their morphology was multifaceted. After the students finished their drawings, we presented our project. The students were very interested in the topic and we continued discussing about synthetic biology and the different fields of research.</p>
