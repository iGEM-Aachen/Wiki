				<h2>RZR-beta-ER</h2>
				<p>Our biobrick is a basic part, which also is one of the key-elements of our biosensor: 
				the receptor RZR-beta (RAR-related orphan receptor beta) with the modified DNA-binding domain.<br></br>
				RZR is a melatonin-sensitive nuclear receptor and transcription factor. 
				By exchanging its native DNA-binding site by the site of the well-known Estrogen Receptor (ER), 
				we made it possible to use reporter genes under the control of the Estrogen Response Element (ERE). 
				This system can be easily adopted for different receptors and therefore for the detection/measurement of different analytes, 
				while the reporter system stays the same. <br></br>
				The codon usage of our biobrick is adopted to S. cerevisiae, as RZR is a human receptor and S. cerevisiae is eukaryotic model organism.
