				<h2>RZR&#946-ER </h2>
				<h3>The part &#38 our project</h3>
				<p>This part is a key-part of our project as it links the biological project-part to our hardware device as we do not only use it in our yeast-cell based approach, 
				but also for the cell-free biosensor.</p>
				<h3>Usage</h3>
				<p>The RZR- &#946 (RAR related orphan receptor) is a melatonin-sensitive nuclear receptor and transcription factor.
				By exchanging its native DNA-binding site by the site of the well-known Estrogen Receptor (ER), 
				we made it possible to use reporter genes under the control of the Estrogen Response Element (ERE). 
				This system can be easily adopted for different receptors and therefore for the detection/measurement of different analytes, 
				while the reporter system stays the same. <br></br>
				The codon usage of our biobrick is adopted to S. cerevisiae, as RZR is a human receptor and S. cerevisiae is eukaryotic model organism.
