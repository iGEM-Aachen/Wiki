				<h4>05/28</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>Creation of YPD-Medium:</b></u></li>
						<p> 
							1000 ml YPD-Medium were created after the protocol <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Wetlab/Protocol24">Liquid YPD Medium</a> in order to enable production of S. cerevisiae overnight cultures
							wich are needed for creation of competent cells and genome isolation. 
						</p>
					<li><u><b>S. cerevisiae overnight culture</b></u></li>
						<p>
							In order to produce competent cells for our project S. cerevisiae BY4742 cells were used for two overnight in YPD-Medium.two different colonies of S.cerevisiae 
							were used for two different overnight culturein 5 ml YPD medium each. Both inoculated tubes were let grown overnight at 30 °C.
						</p>
					<li><u><b>Creation of Yeast dropout medium without leucine</b></u></li>
						<p>
							500 ml Yeast dropout medium without leucine were produced after protocol <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Wetlab/Protocol27">yeast dropout medium</a>. In this case it was necessary to produce medium without leucin 
							because the fist KO it has to be done has an auxotrophy marker for leucin.
						</p>
				</ul>
				<h4>05/29</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>IDT Primer Resuspension (PAA1 KO)</b></u></li>
						<p> 
							The first primers for the KO of the yeast gene PAA1 were resuspended in TE-Puffer (Volume = 10 times their nanomoles) to reduce the possibility 
							that DNAses could damage the storaged DNA.
						</p>
					<li><u><b>Creation of Competent Cells (BY4742)</b></u></li>
						<p>
							The genetic modification of WT BY4247 S. cerevisiae cells can only be achieved if they has been maden competent. In order achieve this
							the zymo research kit for creation of competent cells was used(<a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Wetlab/Protocol20">Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit</a>).
							Overnight cultures has been already prepared on the previous day.
						</p>
					<li><u><b>Creation of 1,2 % Agarose Solution</b></u></li>
						<p>
							500 ml agarose solution for gel electrophoresis were produced (Protopcol: <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Wetlab/Protocol10">Gel Electrophoresis solution</a>).
						</p>
					<li><u><b>PCR for KO Fragments (PAA1 KO)</b></u></li>
						<p>
							After the primer dilution, it was possible to start a PCR to amplify the needed fragments for the ztransformation. In this case, three were
							the amplified fragments: upside homologous arm, downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotrophie marker. These are needed for the creation of 
							an integration cassette which can be used for genome integration. 
						</p>
				</ul>
				<h4>05/30</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>Gel Electrophoresis for PAA1 fragments production PCR (05/29):</b></u></li>
						<p> 
							the gele electrophoresis showed only for the upside homologous arm positive results. It was necessary to repeat the PCR for the other fragments.
						</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>Purification of ampflified Upside Homologous arm</b></u></li>
						<p>
							For the purifcation of the upside homologous arm for the PAA1 KO cassette a PCR clean-up kit was used (<a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Wetlab/Protocol2">PCR clean up kit</a>.
							After the purification the concentration was measured with a nanodrop machine. 
							<hr>
							Results: DNA: 37,6 [ng/ul]      A260/280: 1,8 [-]
							<hr>
							New PCR was needed to achieve higher DNA concentration of the fragment for the transformation.
						</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>PCR for Upside Homologous Arm, Leu5 Auxotropie Marker and Downside Homologous Arm</b></u></li>
						<p>
							A new PCR was needed because the previous one did not worked or showed results wich are not good enough for a transformation in BY4742. A gradient PCR
		                    was started for the fragments which did not showed any results (downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotropie marker). For the upside homologous arm
							the same annealing temperature was chosen as for the previous PCR (05/29) and as template was used the newly purified upside homologous arm fragment 
							(05/30). 
						</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>Gel Electrophoresis for upside homologous arm (05/30) and PCR clean-up</b></u></li>
						<p>
							Gel electrophoresis showed good results for the upside homologous arm fragment. Consequently, fragment was purified with a PCR clean-up kit.
							<br>
							Results: DNA: 50,5 ng/ul       A260/280: 1,98 [-]
						</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>Gel Electrophoresis for Leu5 Auxotrophie Marker and Downside Homologous Arm (05/30) and PCR clean-up</b></u></li>
						<p>
							Gel electrophoresis showed bad results for every single fragments. Consequently it was necessary to try a new PCR with fresh isolated genome 
							and a different gradient for the annealing temperature.
						</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>Test of competent BY4742 (05/30) with Plasmid p0255 on plates without leucin</b></u></li>
						<p>
							Before usege it is necessary to test the created competed cells produced with <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Wetlab/Protocol20">Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit</a>. To test them,
							a trasmformation with the plasmid p0255 was performed (<a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Wetlab/Protocol20">Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit</a> was also used for the transformation).
							Cells were let grown overnight at 30 °C on plates without leucin.

						</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>Gel Electrophoresis for Leu5 Auxotrophie Marker and Downside Homologous Arm (06/01)</b></u></li>

							<hr>
							Results: DNA: 95,1 ng/ul       A260/280: 1,87[-]
						</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>Creation of LiOAC with 10% SDS</b></u></li>
						<p>
							LiOAC with 10% SDS is an important compound for cell transformation and because it was no more avaiable it was necessary to create it again .
						</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>Gel Electrophoresis for upside homologous arm (05/30) and PCR clean-up</b></u></li>
						<p>
							Gel electrophoresis showed good results for the upside homologous arm fragment. Consequently, fragment was purified with a PCR clean-up kit.

						</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>Isolation of S. cerevisiae BY4742 genome:</b></u></li>
				
						<p> 
							Genome was isolated to be used as template for the gradient PCR for downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotrophie marker. Isolation was performed 
							after <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Wetlab/Protocol19"> "Quick and Dirty" protocol</a>. Four genomes from four different BY4742 colonies were isolated. Final concentratioj was determined

					<li><u><b>Gel Electrophoresis for Leu5 Auxotrophie Marker and Downside Homologous Arm (06/01)</b></u></li>
						<p>
							Gel electrophoresis showed good results for both fragments. Consequently, fragment was purified with a PCR clean-up kit.
							<hr>
							Results (downside homologouse arm): DNA: 57,1 ng/ul       A260/280: 1,83 [-]
							<hr>
							Results (Leu5 auxotrophie marker): DNA: 95,1 ng/ul       A260/280: 1,87[-]
						</p>
					<li><u><b>Transformation of BY4742 cells with PAA1 KO Cassette</b></u></li>
						<p>
							Transformation was performed after <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Wetlab/Protocol18">chemical transformation of S. cerevisiae protocol</a>. Amplified fragments upside homologous arm,
							downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotrophie marker were used for the transformation. As a positive controll plasmid p0255 was transformed in competent
							cells. As a negative control WT S. cerevisiae BY4742 was used. All different transformation approches were plated on plates without leucin and incubated
							at 30 °C.
						</p>
				</ul>
			<h4>06/05</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>PCR for Upside Homologous arm and Downside Homologous Arm:</b></u></li>
						<p> 
							A new PCR was needed because the concentration of the PAA1 KO fragments was nearly enough for a single transformation in BY4742. A gradient PCR
		                    was started for the fragments which did not showed any results (downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotropie marker). For the upside homologous arm
							the same annealing temperature was chosen as for the previous PCR (05/30) and as template was used the newly purified upside homologous arm fragment 
							(05/30). 
						</p>
					<li><u><b>Gel Electrophoresis for  Upside Homologous arm and Downside Homologous Arm(06/02)</b></u></li>
						<p>
							Gel electrophoresis showed good results for both fragments. Consequently, fragment was purified with a PCR clean-up kit.
							<hr>
							Results: DNA (upside homologous arm): 12,4 ng/ul       A260/280: 2,29 [-]
							<hr>
							Results: DNA (downside homologous arm): 22,7 ng/ul       A260/280: 2,26 [-]
							<hr>
							Due to low DNA concentration and high number of proteins and impurities, it was necessary to dispose of the purified fragments.
						</p>
					<li><u><b>Transformation of BY4742 cells with PAA1 KO Cassette</b></u></li>
						<p>
							Transformation was performed after <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Wetlab/Protocol20">Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit</a>. Amplified fragments upside homologous arm,
							downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotrophie marker were used for the transformation. As a positive controll plasmid p0255 was transformed in competent
							cells. As a negative control WT S. cerevisiae BY4742 was used. All different transformation approches were plated on plates without leucin and incubated
							at 30 °C.
						</p>
					<li><u><b>Creation of 2 M Betaine Stock Solution</b></u></li>
						<p>
							Thus, it has been observed that the performed PCR do not lead to high product concentration, it was decided to add betaine to the PCR mastermix 
							(10% of the total mastermix volume has been shown to have a positive effect on the DNA production). Consequently, 30 ml of 2 M betaine solution 
							were produced. Betaine was afterward stored at 4 °C.
						</p>
				</ul>
			<h4>06/06</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b> Production PCR for Upside Homologous arm and Downside Homologous Arm:</b></u></li>
						<p> 
							A new PCR was needed because the concentration of the PAA1 KO fragments was not enough for any single transformation in BY4742. A gradient PCR
		                    was started for the fragments which did not showed any results (downside homologous arm and Leu5 auxotropie marker). For the upside homologous arm
							the same annealing temperature was chosen as for the previous PCR (05/30). As template were used the newly purified upside homologous arm fragment 
							with low concentrartion(05/30) and BY4742 isolated genome (genome 1 06/01) for downside homologous fragment. 
						</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>Gel Electrophoresis for  Upside Homologous arm and Downside Homologous Arm</b></u></li>
						<p>
							Gel electrophoresis showed good results for both fragments. Consequently, fragment was purified with a PCR clean-up kit.
							<hr>
							Results(upside homologous arm): DNA: 4,1 ng/ul       A260/280: 1,78 [-]
							<hr>
							Results (downside homologous arm): DNA: 93,8 ng/ul       A260/280: 1,53 [-]
							<hr>
							Due to low DNA concentration and high number of proteins and impurities, it was necessary to dispose of the upside homologous arm.
						</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>Transformation of dH5-alpha E. coli cells</b></u></li>
						<p>
							Every used auxotrophie marker is contained in plasmid which we recieved from our laboratory, however it was necessary to produce some backups 
							in E. coli dh5-alpha, because the recieved quantity of plasmid was barley enough for two PCRs. Consequently, a the recieved plasmid p0257 was 
							transformed in E. coli. Transformed cell were incubated at 37 °C overnight.
						</p>
				</ul>
			<h4>06/07</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b> Overnight cultures with ampicillin LB-Medium for transformed E. coli dh5-alpha cells (06/06):</b></u></li>
						<p> 
							The transformation of the E. coli cells dh5-alpha was successful. Two colonies were used for an overnight culture in 5 ml LB-medium with ampicillin 
							each. Overnight cultures will be used for plasmid isolation.
						</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>Gradient PCR for the Downside Homologous Arm and gel electrophoresis</b></u></li>
						<p>
							A new PCR was needed because new DNA of the downside momologous arm has to be used for a transformation. A gradient PCR
							was started. In spite of using betaine and fresh isolated genome, it was not possible to achieve downside homologous arm production. 
						</p>
				</ul>
			<h4>06/08</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b>Gradient PCR for the Downside Homologous Arm and gel electrophoresis</b></u></li>
							<p>
								A new PCR was needed because new DNA of the downside momologous arm has to be used for a transformation. A gradient PCR
								was started. With this PCR three different PCR protocols should be tested for the same PAA1 KO fragment (downside homologous arm).
							</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>							
					<li><u><b> Gel electrophoresis for the gradient PCR to test different PCR protocols:</b></u></li>
							<p> 
								Only, did one protocols work. The protocol which worked is the one with usage of ten percent betaine in the PCR mastermix and twice as much Enzyme 
								as forseen in the original PCR protocol. Now, a unique protocol could be establish for further PCRs.
								Due to the small used sample volume for the PCR, it was not possible to purified the amplified fragment.
				</ul>
			<h4>06/07</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><u><b> Overnight cultures with ampicillin LB-Medium for transformed E. coli dh5-alpha cells (06/06):</b></u></li>
						<p> 
							The transformation of the E. coli cells dh5-alpha was successful. Two colonies were used for an overnight culture in 5 ml LB-medium with ampicillin

			<h4>06/11</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><u><b>Gradient PCR for the Downside Homologous Arm and gel electrophoresis</b></u></li>
							<p>
								two PCRs were carried out with the new establish protocol. Both, were gradient PCR. However, the new protocol was used, both PCR failed.
								Probably, failure happend because we had to use a very small amout of  BY4742 genome which was difficult to pipette.
							</p>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><u><b>Plasmid isolation of p0257 shuttle vector from E. coli dh5-alpha</b></u></li>
									<p>
										Produced overnight E. coli dh5-alpha overnight cultures with p0257 (06/10) were used to extract the plasmid p0257. Extraction 
										was performed with a purification kit (protocol <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Wetlab/Protocol1"> plasmid clean up</a>).

			<h4>06/12</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><u><b>Creation of 100 ng/ml stock solutions for the isolated genome</b></u></li>
							<p>
								Isolated genpome was diluited with TE puffer in order to achieve a concentration of 100 ng/ul, wich can be used as a stock 
								solution for PCR mastermixes. 5 ml of stock solution were prepared. (Genome 1 produced on the 06/01 was used for the diluition)
						</p>
					</ul>
					<ul>
					<li><u><b> Gradient PCR for downside homologous arm with different template concentrations:</b></u></li>
							<p> 
								As it was not possible to produce ampflify any downside homologous arm anymore, it was decided to test different genome concentration
								which has always been used as template. It was supposed that genome could reduce the efficiency of the PCR, so it was decided to test different concentrations
								of it. Tested were three different concentration: 425 ng/ul, 100 ng/ul and 30 ng/ul.
							</p>	
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><u><b>Gel electrophoresi for PCR to test different template concentrations</b></u></li>
							<p>
								Best results could be observed for a template concentration of 100 ng /ul in the PCR mastermix.
						</p>
					</ul>
					<ul>
					<li><u><b> touchdown PCR for downside homologous arm:</b></u></li>
							<p> 
								As it was not possible to produce ampflify any downside homologous arm anymore, it was decided to try a touchdown PCR whose annealing temperature 
								is changed every cycle, just because it was supposed that also the annealing temperature could be a problem.
							</p>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><u><b>Gel electrophoresi for the touchdown PCR:</b></u></li>
							<p>
								Gel showed no bands at all. The PCR did not worked. We will try again a production PCR with 1000 ng/ul DNA as a template and a different 
								gradient for the annealing temperature.
						</p>

		<h4>06/13</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><u><b>Creation of YPD-Medium plates and YPD liquid Medium</b></u></li>
							<p>
								On this day two plates with modified E. coli cellls from Helsinki has came. They contain DNA modifications which enable the usage of RZR1
								transcription and its detection (luciferase was integrated as a reporter). In order to utilise them it was necessary to make backups and 
								overnight cultures. Consequently, it was necessary to produce fresh solid and liquid YPD-Medium. 500 ml of each were produced.(Protocols: <a 
								href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Wetlab/Protocol24">YPD-Liquid-Medium</a> and <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Wetlab/Protocol25">YPD-Solid-Medium</a>) In addition, these modified cells contain a plasmid with auxotrophie marker which
								we are not to need. As a result, it is necessary to make the cell lose the plasmid. In cónclusion, it was decided to let them grew a few days
								in full YPD medium.

					</ul>
					<ul>
					<li><u><b> Plating of modified BMA64-a1 S. cerevisiae cells from Helsinki </b></u></li>

					<ul>
						<li><u><b>IDT Primer Resuspension (PAA1 KO) for Helsinki cells</b></u></li>
							<p>
								New primers were recieved for the PAA1 KO because the old ones did not show any goos result and consequently they were rtesuspended in TE buffer to achieve a final concentration in the tubes of 100 ng DNA per ml.
								the used resuspension volume was ten times the value of the nanomoles primers contained in the tube

					</ul>
		<h4>06/14</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><u><b>gradient PCR for downside Homologous Arm with Leu5 Auxotrophoe marker as a positive control</b></u></li>
							<p>
								New gradient PCR was started to test the new primers we orderderd from IDT for the amplification of downside homologous arm. As a positive control for
								the mastermix, we amplificated within the same PCR the Leu5 Auxotrophoe marker fragment which has already shown good results in many different
								PCRs. 
						</p>
					</ul>
					<ul>
					<li><u><b> Gel electrophoresis for the gradient PCR for downside homologous arm </b></u></li>
							<p> 
								The gel electrophoresis only showed good results for the positive control (Leu5 Auxotrophoe marker fragment). It probably depends on the gradient or on the 
								used template concentration.

					<ul>
						<li><u><b>Preparaion of yeast dropout medium withouth Leucine and Tryptophan </b></u></li>
							<p>
								Due to the new recieved cells and the necessity to work in the future with different genes and consequently markers, it was needed to produce new media suitable
								for different selectable markers.500 ml yeast dropout medium withouth Leucine and 250 ml yeast dropout medium withouth Tryptophan were produced. (Protocol:
