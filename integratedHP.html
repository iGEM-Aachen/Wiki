											<h3>European Drug Approval</h3>
											<h4>Interview with Leon Bongers and Tania Mattila about melatonin as medication and its approval.</h4>
											<hr>
											<p>
											We talked with Leon Bongers and Tania Mattila from the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB) about the process of approval 
											for Melatonin in the Netherlands and in the European Union.<br> 
											We learned that the availability of melatonin could only change through pressure of pharmaceutical companies. 
											They also dicussed with us the chances and risks of melatonin supplementation.<br><br>
											We were very surprised that there is such a strict regulation of the availability of melatonin in our country.  
											Circadin is a prescription medication containing melatonin, which has been approved in the whole European Union from the age of 55. <br>
											In Germany, in contrast to other countries, melatonin products as dietary supplements are strictly regulated, while in our neighbour country the Netherlands, 
											they are freely available. <br>
											We learned from the IGJ (Inspectie Gezondheidszorg en Jeugd), the responsible institution for the approval of dietary supplements in the Netherlands, 
											that a melatonin-containing product is only considered a medicine if it contains at least 0,3 mg of melatonin and claims to cure a disease. 
											<br></br>
											Our team member Katrin interviewed clinical assessor Tania Mattila and Leon Bongers, the Senior Regulatory Project Leader of Pharmacotherapeutic Group I, 
											both from the MEB. Leon Bongers is responsible for the approval of melatonin as a medicine in the Netherlands. <br>
											He and Mrs. Mattila explained to us that in the Netherlands it is assumed that the population only takes melatonin after 
											consultation with a doctor and that the number of studies on melatonin for 
											short-term use is sufficient since there are no worrying side effects when taken correctly, 
											but there are not enough studies on melatonin for a longer period. In addition, 
											we learned that it is apparently not enough to raise general awareness to the positive effects of melatonin in the society. <br>
											An amendment to the law in Germany could only be achieved by pressure from the pharmaceutical industry. 
											Then, melatonin could be available in Germany for humans under fifty-five, too. <br></br>
											To learn more about the process of drug approval in the EU and to inform yourself about the risks and when it is reasonable to supplement melatonin, 
											please read our interview below.</p>
											<br></br>
											<h3>The Interview</h3>
											<p>
											Katrin: Have you heard about the correlation between Melatonin and neurological disorders, like depression, Parkinson's,
											Alzheimer's disease and fibromyalgia?<br></br>
											
											Leon Bongers: We know that a melatonin disbalance can play a role in many disorders like the ones that you mentioned. 
											But I think there is too little data available concerning the effects on giving melatonin to correct the imbalance in this disorders,
											there haven't been specific claims for melatonin disorders. 
											So it hasn't played a part in the authorization application that we have had so far.<br><br>
											
											Katrin: We think it would be interesting to know more about the process of the medical authorization in the CBG and also how 
											you work together with the EU.<br></br>
											
											Leon Bongers: The MEB and most regulatory authorities in Europe only work by paper. 
											The tests are being done by a pharmaceutical company that often relies completely on papers and literature. 
											A company submits to us a dossier with detail on the manufacturing, indication, and safety of the product.
											Then the application is assessed by different specialized assessment groups, for example, clinical assessors like Taina, 
											but there is also a non-clinical assessment. The assessors make reports which are scheduled for a board meeting. 
											The MEB consists mainly of two parts, the board with about 17 highly educated professors who are making the final decision 
											on an application, and the drafters of the report, me as a regulator et cetera who are doing the work and prepare the reports for 
											the board. There the assessment is discussed and we mostly draw a list of questions to the company which they have to answer. 
											After their reply, we do a reassessment and a final decision is taken.<br>
											But a lot of decisions are made in the EU. I just talked about the national procedure, 
											that's when a company decides to make an application in only one member state, like for melatonin supplementation. 
											But for example, Circadin, as a product that is registered in all member states of the European Union, has a centralized procedure. 
											It means that an application is made in all member states at the same time and an assessment is done by one member state. 
											They draw out a report which is being discussed on a European level in a specific meeting at the EMA [European Medicines Agency]. 
											A company also has the option to make the applications only in a few member states, 
											then one member state will make reports which are circulated to the other member states and are asked what they think of the assessments.<br><br>
											
											Katrin: You told us that the EMA and, for example, the MEB have different medicines that they evaluate, 
											so they don't interfere. But if the MEB authorized a medicine, could the EMA object to it?<br></br>
											
											Leon Bongers: Normally the EMA or another member state is not even aware of such a decision. 
											We issue marketing authorizations to a company. But it might happen for example when a member state in Europe considers 
											that a product does more harm than that it is efficacious. Then the member state has the opportunity to refer a commission in Europe, 
											the CHMP, the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. 
											The CHMP advises the European Commission which can take the final decision on whether a medicinal product can be used for a certain indication.<br><br>
											Katrin: Could you say something about the risks of taking melatonin as a supplement without a physician's advice, 
											or are there also benefits?<br></br>
											
											Taina Mattila: In principle, there is no specific risk in short-term use. But for example, 
											the long-term risks with children are not completely known, for example for maturation. 
											And I think when you take melatonin in the wrong way or in a wrong time it can also influence your own circadian rhythm. 
											In that way, it can be harmful.<br>
											Taking melatonin for a sleep problem might deprive yourself of an effective treatment that a physician could be able to give to you. 
											Soft measures for improving sleep could be nightly rituals and other non-medicinal measures. 
											Basically, the benefits of melatonin have really conclusively in my personal opinion been only shown in jet lag and to some extent 
											to the indication of Circadin at the moment. 
											So if you ask about short-term safety risks we are not that worried, but we are with using it for a long time and with indications where 
											it might not have any kind of effects.<br><br>
											
											Katrin: I read that a side effect of taking melatonin is blood in the urine. Do you know where that comes from?<br></br>
											
											Taina Mattila: Unfortunately I don't know. But of course melatonin is a hormone, 
											that is involved in a lot of different systems in the body and has the potential to affect them.<br><br>
											
											Katrin: Circadin is only allowed from the age of 55 years onwards. When the company wanted it to be allowed, 
											they only asked to allow it for the age of 55 years onwards. Can you imagine why 
											they took this limit and not for example and didn't allow it for all adults?<br></br>
											
											Taina Mattila: The main large trial was performed in patients over 55 years of age. 
											So the data for lower age groups was not available to such an extent that it could be approvable. 
											There was a lot of discussion in the CHMP and in the end, it was approved with a majority decision. 
											You should also know that the indication is specifically for insomnia characterized by poor sleep quality. 
											So it is not an overall insomnia indication and it is limited to age.<br><br>
											
											Katrin: Is there a discussion about lowering the age limit?<br></br>
											
											Leon Bongers: In general one can say that the age limit will not shift as long as the company is not asking for 
											it because a change or an application is made by a company. 
											And as long as a company does nothing, the age limit will not change. 
											So they have to substantiate why the age limit could be lower. But I think they have no chance of lowering it in normal healthy people.<br></br>
											
											Taina Mattila: They would be asked to show some new data for it, so I don't think the company is interested in doing studies for that.<br><br>
											
											Katrin: I recently read that Germany said that that there are not so many studies, and also there are no long-term studies. 
											What can you tell me about it?<br></br>
											
											Taina Mattila: There are many studies being done, some positive, some negative. <br>
											In most kinds of sleep disorders, the efficacy is inconclusive. It is unclear whether the effects are clinically relevant. 
											So, for example, a patient falls asleep 10 minutes faster than he does normally, 
											does it have an effect on the patient's wellbeing or functioning? What is the threshold how much faster you have to fall asleep in order to improve your quality of life? 
											What I've seen so far is that in jetlag there is the strongest evidence of efficacy.<br><br>
											
											Katrin: Did you hear that taking Melatonin could be also beneficial for shift workers and have you heard of other benefits?<br></br>
											
											Taina Mattila: On shiftwork, there is not enough evidence for efficacy based on what I have seen in the literature.<br></br>
											
											Leon Bongers: There is EFSA, that's the European authority for food products and supplements. 
											They have decided on the indication of the reduction of sleep onset [the time you are still awake after going to bed]. 
											It seems that it is indeed reduced by melatonin. But so far the MEB has not accepted the sleep onset time reduction as an indication for a 
											medicinal product and therefore it cannot be registered for this indication. 
											But there was a lot of discussion in the MEB. So far we have not accepted it as an indication for melatonin as a medicinal product. 
											But it's the most important reason to use it as a supplement.</p><br>

											<h3>Aachen Engineering Award</h3>
											<h4>Informing public personae about iGEM</h4>
											<hr>
											<p>
											On September 7, 2018, we met Emmanuelle Marie Charpentier at the Aachen Engineering Award. 
											She impressed and motivated us very much with her work and her character. 
											It was not only the first time that a woman, but also a person with a biological and chemical background was awarded this prize. 
											This has given us additional confidence for the future in the role of biosciences and equality.
											Besides that, we briefly presented our project and iGEM to Klaus Radermacher, Head of Medical Technology at RWTH University, 
											and to the new Rector Ulrich RÃ¼diger.

												<h3>Meetups</h3>	 
												<h4>German Meetup</h4>
												<p>
												After a long period of researching, we finally met most of the German iGEM-teams in June at Marburg. 
												We not only got to know many inspiring people, but also had the opportunity to discuss our projects with them. 
												Especially, the sharing of experiences and failures would help us later on in our journey. <br>
												Furthermore, various scientists and organizations joined the meetup and presented to us their experiences and advice. 
												We learned how to handle steps backwards and how they can improve a scientist's work. <br>
												A big thanks to the iGEM team Marburg for organizing and hosting this great event!

												<h4>European Meetup</h4>
												<p> Only one month after the meetup in Marburg we went to the European meetup 
												in Munich where we had a great time. We had the chance to meet the German teams again as well as meeting even 
												more awesome young researchers, in particularly, the iGEM team of Utrecht with whom we started a collaboration afterwards. <br>
												In addition, we met a bunch of scientists and entrepreneurs who shared their wisdom with us. 
												We listened to talks about current topics in the field of synthetic biology and learned new skills at workshops. <br>
												We thank iGEM LMU and TU Munich for the organization of this thrilling weekend!

											<h3>School project</h3>
	
											<h4>Teaching the basics of microbiology</h4>

											<p>To meet the challenges of the future, biologic applications are going to be more and more relevant. Thus, it is essential to make this work field interesting for young people. With a school project, we tried to make the field of synthetic biology more appealing for them. <br>
											Since we were very surprised about the major role of melatonin in the human body and the little familiarity in the public, we took this opportunity to inform our audience. <br>
											At the beginning of September, we went to 10th-grade students at the Herzogenrath Highschool to show them the fundamentals of lab work. We carried out the lessons on three different days.
											</p>

											<h5>First day:</h5> 
											<p>At the beginning of the first day, we presented the schedule for the upcoming one and a half weeks. After a small introduction about us, we talk about safety in a laboratory, working sterile and different media types for the cultivation of microorganisms. We split the class into groups of four students. First, the students weighed out the different components to prepare a YPD medium in Petri dishes. We autoclaved the media and explained the physical principles of autoclavation. In the end, the pupil poured the YPD medium into the Petri dishes.</p>

											<h5>Second day:</h5>

											<p>On the second day, the students inoculated the Petri dishes. Every group had four Petri dishes: one plate which was exposed to the air, another which was used to test the effect of ampicillin on the growth of microorganisms, and another two where they could test the contamination of different surfaces. Furthermore, we explained the functionality of antibiotics. The plates were incubated at 30Â°C.</p>

											<h5>Third day:<h5>

											<p>Seven days later we evaluated the plates and talked about the different organisms that grew on the Petri dishes. To get a closer look, we used a light microscope to analyze how their morphology was multifaceted. After the students finished their drawings, we presented our project. The students were very interested in the topic and we continued discussing about synthetic biology and the different fields of research.</p>

											<h3>Finding the idea</h3>
											<h4>The first steps towards a certain project idea</h4>
											<p>
											In February 2018 we started brainstorming to find a project that could potentially transform peopleâs lives. <br>
											Ranging from a car fueled by hydrogen produced by cyanobacteria, 
											over the decrease of the detection-time of slowly growing pathogenic bacteria we had plenty of ideas. 
											We saw the greatest potential in the simplification of the diagnosis of a melatonin underproduction since the current measurement takes up to six weeks. <br>
											One of our team members, Biel Badia RoigÃ©, had already experienced this issue. 
											The stunning findings in the past decades revealed a strong correlation with numerous diseases, 
											so our biosensor could speed up the diagnosis of multiple diseases. The idea of a faster, 
											cheaper and more versatile method of melatonin-measurement also resonated with our PIâs Dr. Wiechert, Dr. Schwaneberg and Dr. Bank. 
											Our first milestone was achieved.

											<h3>Helsinki</h3>
											<h4>Using luciferase under the control of the Estrogen Response Element as reporter</h4>
											<p>During our first months of research we noticed a research group in the Aalto University (Helsinki), 
											who developed a yeast-cell based assay for the detection of different analytes, i. e. Estrogen, using different nuclear receptors. <br> 
											We decided, that the system would be suitable for our project, as we also planned to use the specific nuclear receptor RZR 
											(Retinoid-related orphan receptor-beta) for the detection of melatonin. <br> 
											After contacting the research group, they directly send us their modified strain (BMA64-1A), 
											so that we could use the integrated firefly luciferase gene as a reporter under the control of the Estrogen Response Element (ERE).
