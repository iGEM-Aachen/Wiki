	<h4>The first steps towards a certain project idea</h4>
	<p>
		In February 2018 we started brainstorming to find a project that could potentially transform people’s lives. <br>
		Ranging from a car fueled by hydrogen produced by cyanobacteria, 
		over the decrease of the detection-time of slowly growing pathogenic bacteria we had plenty of ideas. 
		We saw the greatest potential in the simplification of the diagnosis of a melatonin underproduction since the current measurement takes up to six weeks. <br>
		One of our team members, Biel Badia Roigé, had already experienced this issue. 
		The stunning findings in the past decades revealed a strong correlation with numerous diseases, 
		so our biosensor could speed up the diagnosis of multiple diseases. The idea of a faster, 
		cheaper and more versatile method of melatonin-measurement also resonated with our PI’s Dr. Wiechert, Dr. Schwaneberg and Dr. Bank. Our first milestone was achieved.
