				<hr>
				<br>
				<p>	This year iGEM-Aachen consists of 13 team-members: 8 Biologists, 3 Biotechnology students, 1 Mechanical Engineer and 1 Industrial Engineer. <br>
				They were brought together by their curiosity and their wish to create something new. After hours of discussion and planning, not only the project,
				the construction of a novel biosensor for melatonin, was found, but also these people became a team.
