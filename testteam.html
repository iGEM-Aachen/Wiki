						<h4 class="popup-description">Our half German, half Mexican and always-ready-to-spice-things-up friend.
						He studies Biotechnology and decided to join iGEM because it was a great opportunity to learn a lot of
						new things. There haven’t been many days Adrian wasn’t motivated to work. Even after some of his 
						important DNA fragments were accidentally thrown away and we didn't know whether to laugh or cry, 
						he kept up his good work. With all the efforts Adrian’s making, he surely is going to knock out all
						the genes. And as if all this risky lab work wasn’t enough, Adrian also likes to boulder in his free 
						time.</h4>

						an appointment and there is no door which can stop him till he has got what he wants. He is also very 
						cautious about the scientific correctness of the lab work. Not a mystery that in almost every case his 
						work is absolutely correct! In his spare time, he sails the world and rebuilds classic cars.</h4>

						Originating from Zwickau in the east of Germany, she moved to Aachen to study Biotechnology. Tearing down walls, social and economic, is in her DNA:
